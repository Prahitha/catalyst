          <div class="description">During her long career as a pharmacologist, Elion helped develop 
              countless drugs that are used in the treatment of AIDS, malaria, herpes, and cancer. Along with George Herbert Hitchings, 
              she invented the first immunosuppressive drug, Azathioprine, which was initially used for chemotherapy patients, and eventually
              for organ transplants.</div>

          <div class="description">Chief among Curie’s many achievements include discovering radioactivity and inventing a mobile X-ray 
              unit that was employed during World War I. With her husband, Pierre, Curie also discovered the radioactive elements polonium
               and radium — and developed techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes. In 1903, Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel 
               Prize. After her first win in physics, she later earned an award in chemistry — making her the first person to have been awarded
                twice. </div>

          <div class="description">Hau was the first to bring light, which moves at a constant, breakneck pace of 186,282 miles 
              per second in a vacuum, to a screeching halt. She did it within a cloud of sodium atoms cooled to a few billionths 
              of a degree above absolute zero. Although the beams of light can't be seen under such conditions, their information is 
              imprinted on the sodium cloud "as if we were writing a hologram. When we feel like it, we let them loose again and
               send them on their way," says the physicist, who is trying to miniaturize the experiment.</div>
